<h1>Aftershock by Pouya</h1>
<hr>
<p>Been below the average, still, I walk tall<br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_de_Ville_series">'96 DeVille</a>, feelin' like the hero of the hood<br>
    I never meant to be what I became<br>
    I'm a Florida boy that couldn't afford a Ford<br>
    At the corner store with five of my homies<br>
    With the Glock inside my jacket, make a racket, tryna sell a sack<br>
    So I can get a hatchback, cop pulled me over, that's a setback<br>
    It ain't nothing I can't bounce back from<br>
    They love my style, they love the way that I been using my tongue<br>
    But, hey, how you hate somebody puttin' on for your city?<br>
    I got a thousand enemies and yet they all wanna rip me<br>
    But even if you kill me, I will never die, my words will live forever<br>
    I thought this money was supposed to make my life lil' better<br>
    But now this money got me dancin', dancin' with the devil<br>
    Heavy metal, got my pants saggin' like a '90s rebel<br>
    I can never settle, I need my settlements lately<br>
    Been around the world but Miami is where my grave be</p>

<p><strong>Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br>
    I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized<br>
    Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh<br>
    Watch me drop the top like an aftershock, yuh<br>
    Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br>
    I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized<br>
    Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh<br>
    Watch me drop the top like an aftershock</strong></p>

<p>Shake hands with the right but on the left, I got the nina<br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams">Serena</a> couldn't serve you rappers better than me either<br>
    Took a gamble with my life, I spent my money on a chain<br>
    Threw it all away to run away from all the pain<br>
    You was a rat from the beginnin', tryna play me like a b****<br>
    I guess that come with the game, the pros and cons of gettin' rich<br>
    Real recognize fake, see it in yo' face<br>
    You hangin' around my **** to get a taste<br>
    Baby, let me tell you somethin'<br>
    Most these rappers got they mans in their pocket<br>
    Locked up to a 3-6-0<br>
    Sold your soul for an all gold rope wrapped around your throat<br>
    And now you walkin' around the city like you runnin' the show<br>
    But I know you got yourself into somethin' hard to get out<br>
    Especially when half the world got your name in their mouth<br>
    You feel the pressure on your spine, cripple up your mind<br>
    Diamond in the rough, waiting to be mined, ayy</p>

    <p><strong>Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br>
        I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized<br>
        Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh<br>
        Watch me drop the top like an aftershock, yuh<br>
        Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br>
