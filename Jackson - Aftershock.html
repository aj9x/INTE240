        >'96 DeVille</a
      >, feelin' like the hero of the hood<br />
      I never meant to be what I became<br />
      I'm a Florida boy that couldn't afford a Ford<br />
      At the corner store with five of my homies<br />
      With the Glock inside my jacket, make a racket, tryna sell a sack<br />
      So I can get a hatchback, cop pulled me over, that's a setback<br />
      It ain't nothing I can't bounce back from<br />
      They love my style, they love the way that I been using my tongue<br />
      But, hey, how you hate somebody puttin' on for your city?<br />
      I got a thousand enemies and yet they all wanna rip me<br />
      But even if you kill me, I will never die, my words will live forever<br />
      I thought this money was supposed to make my life lil' better<br />
      But now this money got me dancin', dancin' with the devil<br />
      Heavy metal, got my pants saggin' like a '90s rebel<br />
      I can never settle, I need my settlements lately<br />
      Been around the world but Miami is where my grave be
    </p>

    <p class="chorus">
      Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br />
      I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized<br />
      Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh<br />
      Watch me drop the top like an aftershock, yuh<br />
      Take my life away and let me die where I reside<br />
      I'm a Florida boy forever, my city immortalized<br />
      Everybody wanna be around me 'cause I'm hot, yuh<br />
      Watch me drop the top like an aftershock
    </p>

      >
      couldn't serve you rappers better than me either<br />
      Took a gamble with my life, I spent my money on a chain<br />
      Threw it all away to run away from all the pain<br />
      You was a rat from the beginnin', tryna play me like a b****<br />
      I guess that come with the game, the pros and cons of gettin' rich<br />
      Real recognize fake, see it in yo' face<br />
      You hangin' around my **** to get a taste<br />
      Baby, let me tell you somethin'<br />
      Most these rappers got they mans in their pocket<br />
      Locked up to a 3-6-0<br />
      Sold your soul for an all gold rope wrapped around your throat<br />
      And now you walkin' around the city like you runnin' the show<br />
      But I know you got yourself into somethin' hard to get out<br />
      Especially when half the world got your name in their mouth<br />
      You feel the pressure on your spine, cripple up your mind<br />
      Diamond in the rough, waiting to be mined, ayy
